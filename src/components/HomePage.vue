		<p>
			Here you are presented with a series of different levels to pracitce and learn touch typing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The first category of levels under 'letters' introduces new letters progressively. The first part of each level is a series of randomly generated groupings of letters. The second part are words consisting of the letters with which we're trying to practise. Refer to the below image for finger placement.

		<p>Your fingers should rest on the home row keys as much as possible. That's your left hand on A,S,D,F and your right hand on J,K,L, ;.</p> 
		<p>When a capital letter is required, use your opposite hand to hit the shift key.</p>
		<p>Practice Regularly.</p>
